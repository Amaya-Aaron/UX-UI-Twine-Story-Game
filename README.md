## UX-UI-Twine-Story-Game:
- Design a Twine game to encompass the design principles discussed in this course.
This is a team project, max team size 2 people, the goal is to create a simple yet engaging non-linear story.

## You can find the Twine Cheat Sheet here

- It could be a gamefied story, meaning it is to teach a concept or highlight a social issue, or just tell a simple story. You can include elements of puzzle games within this: choosing certain paths lead to different ends, a need to collect resources to change outcome of story, inventory system, stats etc.



- Try to include as much HTML/Twine scripting as possible, for example:

- Setting links to new story passages

- Adding style to the passages via the stylesheet

- Adding transitions on hover

- Adding images to passages

- Sizing and positioning elements on screen

- Creating divs in layout structure

- Using variables and if/else statements



## Consider:

- How to structure your story (multiple endings or meaningful choices?)

- Could html page layout or use of colour, typography and images enhance the experience?
